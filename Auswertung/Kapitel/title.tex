    This experiment aims to map a wide range of astronomical objects in the Milky Way. Therefore an antenna in Onsala (Sweden) was used remotely.

    As a first step the main characteristica of this antenna were examined.\\
    By measuring the total power of the sun and taking a grid image of the sun's radiation profile the sun was legitimized as a point source. \\
    Based on the assumption that the \textsc{Salsa}-telescope can be idealized as an aperture, mathematically described by a $\sinc$-function, a \textsc{gaussian} fit was applied to the data. Thus FWHM refered to as angular resolution was quantified as $\SI{6.6 \pm 1.1}{\degree}$. Inferred from that the diameter of the telescope was calculated as $\SI{2.23 \pm 0.37}{\metre}$ in good accordance to the real value of $\SI{2.3}{\metre}$. At last a degree of intrinsic inaccuracy of the telescope was obtained and measured as $\SI{0.976 \pm 0.034}{\degree}$ from the \textsc{gaussian} fit.
